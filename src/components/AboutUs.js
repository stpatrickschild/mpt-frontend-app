    <h2>About Us </h2>
    <p>Why I choose this project is: - I am seeing there is a problem with access to healthcare because people are afraid to get treatment because they are afraid they can’t afford it, or they get treatment and then it causes secondary problems because they can’t afford to pay for it, and it cause this other thing beside health and that stress can impact their outcomes, it can impact their likelihood seeking follow up care. I want to prevent a lot of that by being transparent. My only fear is the DB to maintain and make sure its honest. </p>
    <h2>What is Concierge Medicine </h2>
    <p>Concierge Medicine (also known as retainer medicine) is a relationship between a patient and primary care physician in which the patient pays an annual fee or retainer. In exchange for the retainer, doctors agree to provider enhanced care, including principally a commitment to limit patient loads to ensure adequate time and availability for each patient.  </p>
